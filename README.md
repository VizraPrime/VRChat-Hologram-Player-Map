# Vizra's Hologram Player Location Map
I noticed that there isn't any prefab online for the kind of hologram map used in a lot of game worlds. So I wanted to help people out and make this public!

# Prerequisites

-Nothing, it should have everything from the get-go! (TechMeshPro is in the folder, idk what will happen if you already have it installed.)

# Instalation
-Drag and Drop, Move the _"Holomap"_ prefab where you need it.

-Move the _"HolomapUI"_ where you need it.

-Customize the layout by scaling up _"Holomap-Interior-Rooms"_ to **1**, delete/match up squares/cubes to match the layout of your world, then scale down to **0.0225.**
